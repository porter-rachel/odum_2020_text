################# PREPROCESSING STEP  ###############

## load in data on campaign positions 
load("~/Dropbox/Text_Class/odum_text_2020/positions_data.RData")

## remove any tags, unwanted text for analysis
data$trimmed <- gsub("[\n]", "", data$trimmed)
data$trimmed <- gsub("d5", "", data$trimmed)
data$trimmed <- gsub("d0", "", data$trimmed)
data$trimmed <- gsub(" *\\b[[:alpha:]]{1,2}\\b *", " ", data$trimmed)

## remove numbers, any words that do not begin with a letter
data$trimmed <- gsub('[0-9]+', '', data$trimmed)
data$trimmed <- gsub("[^a-zA-Z]", " ", data$trimmed)

## drop any observations with no text
data <- subset(data, !is.na(data$trimmed))

## create corpus object, set text field
issues <- corpus(data, text_field = "trimmed")

## finish preprocessing steps 
eng.stopwords <- stopwords('english')
eng.stopwords <- c("congress", eng.stopwords)
iss_dfm <- dfm(issues, stem = T,
               remove = eng.stopwords, remove_punct = T)

## optional: examine top features
topfeatures(iss_dfm, 100)

## Convert dfm to stm structure 
iss_stm <- convert(iss_dfm, to = 'stm')
plotRemoved(iss_stm$documents, lower.thresh=seq(1,200, by=20))

## Determining drop threshold 
iss_stm <- prepDocuments(iss_stm$documents, iss_stm$vocab,

################# TOPIC MODELING STEP  ###############

# This is where our researcher determination becomes very important
# the choices we make here will have consequences on our results
# I would suggest replicating your analysis across multiple topic /
# drop thresholds to ensure results are not **model dependent**

# FINDING THE "RIGHT" NUMBER OF TOPICS 
# Per Grimmer and Stewart (2013), there is no surefire way to choose your
# number of topics; but there are data-driven approaches for making this 
# determination. The searchK function allows for the repeated estimation of 
# stms across different k-topic thresholds. These repeated estimations can 
# then be compared across several diagnostic values to determine K. 

model_search <- searchK(iss_stm$documents, iss_stm$vocab, K = c(8:12),
                        prevalence = ~ gender + as.factor(ss_party) + openseat,
                        data = iss_stm$meta, seed = 374075)
plot(model_search)
# Held-out likelihood — the probability of held-out documents given a trained model; goal close to 0
#                       essentially --- how good is the model at predicting held out words?
# Residuals           — If the model is correctly specified. If it correctly specified the multinomial 
#                       likelihood the dispersion of residuals sigma2 should be 1; If > 1, too few topics, 
#                       cannot account well for topic over-dispersion
#                       essentially --- is there too much variability in topics?
# Lower-bound         — approximation to the lower bound on the marginal likelihood. You can think of 
#                       it as the model's internal measure of fit. Goal is to MAXIMIZE
# Semantic Coherence  — Semantic coherence is maximized when the most probable words in a given topic 
#                       frequently co-occur together. Goal is to MAXIMIZE.

initial_model <- stm(documents = iss_stm$documents, vocab = iss_stm$vocab,
                       K = 9, prevalence = ~ gender + as.factor(ss_party) + openseat,
                       data = iss_stm$meta, init.type = "Spectral")

# What is init.type? The spectral approach utilizes the connection of LDA with non-negative matrix 
# factorization that provides theoretical guarantees that the optimal parameters will be recovered. 
# This overcomes issue of local modes, which may cause differences in results based on changes in 
# starting values (i.e. different seeds set). Spectral initialization should produce more consistent
# results across multiple runs; setting the seed becomes unnecesscary.

labelTopics(initial_model, n = 10)

theta <- data.frame(initial_model$theta)

# Highest Prob.***    — Words with the highest probability of ocurring in a given topic 
# FREX words          — Highest probability words re-weighted by how exclusive they are to a given topic 
# Lift words          — Words divided by their overall frequency in other topics 
# Score words         — Divide log frequency of a word in a topic by log frequency in other topics 

# Plotting overall topic frequency 
plot(initial_model, type = "summary", xlim = c(0, .5))

# Plotting overall topic quality 
plot = topicQuality(initial_model,documents=iss_stm$document)
